"AI AND THE FUTURE OF MEDICINE/MANKIND" 
ONTARIO MEDICAL ASSOCIATION (OMA)  TALK SCHEDULED FOR MARCH 21 IS CANCELLED

A few colleagues have reached out to me and asked about the talk. Unfortunately due to Covid-19 precautions the talk will be cancelled and hopefully rescheduled for later this year or virtual presentation.
