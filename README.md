"AI AND THE FUTURE OF MEDICINE/MANKIND" OMA TALK SCHEDULED FOR MARCH 21 IS CANCELLED

A few colleagues have reached out to me and asked about the talk. Unfortunately due to Covid-19 precautions the talk will be cancelled and hopefully rescheduled for later this year or virtual presentation.
Please click this link for the slides intended for the talk:

(You can view the slides in GitHub but there are some 200 slides and GitHub may only display 50 or 100 -- please download the PDF for the full presentation so slides are not cut off.)
